## Outcomes[, events]{.fragment fragment-index=1}[, and probabilities]{.fragment fragment-index=2}

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="65%"}
An [outcome]{.tomato} is a *possible* value we can observe.

<blockquote>
The outcomes of rolling a fair six-sided dice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
</blockquote>

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 style="margin-top: 50px;"}
An [event]{.steelblue} is a *set of distinct* [outcome(s)]{.tomato} we can observe.

<blockquote style="border-left: 0.25em solid steelblue;">
The event that I rolled an odd number with a fair six-sided dice consists of the outcomes 1, 3, and 5.
</blockquote>
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2 style="margin-top: 50px; padding-right: 4pt;"}
A [probability]{.orchid} is a *real number*, $\mathbb{R}$, that takes a value between 0 and 1 **inclusive**, which describes the occurrence of an [event]{.steelblue} based on the "long-run" frequency of the [event]{.steelblue}.

<blockquote style="border-left: 0.25em solid orchid;">
The probability of the event that I rolled an odd number with a fair six-sided dice is 0.5.
</blockquote>

## Random Variables

In Statistics, a **random variable** summarises the [outcomes]{.tomato} (represented as numeric values) of a process by [_**chance alone**_]{.fragment .highlight-blue}.

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: 50px;"}
It is a function whose *domain* is all possible distinct [outcomes]{.tomato} we can observe from a process, and each [outcome]{.tomato} is mapped to a *non-negative* real number, $\mathbb{R}^+$, according to the probability axioms^[See the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) page on the probability axioms you are interested in what they are.].
:::

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: 50px;"}
This is known as the **probability distribution** (that the random variable follows). [As a result, it is standard to denote a random variable with uppercase letters [X]{.MathJax-Font}, [Y]{.MathJax-Font}, etc. and its *domain* with lowercase letters [x]{.MathJax-Font}, [y]{.MathJax-Font}, etc.]{.fragment}

## More on Random Variables

A **random variable** can be used to model the [outcomes]{.tomato} we could observe from a process by _**chance alone**_. [But why do we assign a *non-negative* real number to [outcomes]{.tomato}?]{.fragment}

:::::: {.fragment style="margin-top: 50px;"}
::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="55%"}
Consider the following cases:

::: {.li-line-height-1-1 style="padding-right: 24pt;"}
1. A fair six-sided die, whose [outcomes]{.tomato} are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
2. A uniform random number generator, whose [outcomes]{.tomato} are any real number between 1<br>and 6 inclusive.
:::
::::
:::: {.column width="45%"}
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| class: fragment

# Load in the random package
import random

# One "simulated" die roll
print(random.randint(1, 6))

# One uniform random number
print(random.uniform(1, 6))
```
::::
:::::
::::::

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: 50px;"}
*Case 1* is an example of what is known as a *discrete* random variable, whereas *Case 2* is an example of what is known as a *continuous* random variable. 
:::

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: 50px;"}
The key takeaway is that we should _**always**_ assign [probabilities]{.orchid} to [events]{.steelblue}, *regardless* of the type of random variable.
