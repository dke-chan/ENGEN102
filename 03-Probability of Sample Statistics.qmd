## Random variables &zigrarr; Sample

How is data generated

## [Definition:]{style='color: darkorange'} Sample

-> Probability statement of a sample

## Sample statistics
-> Changes sample-to-sample

## Strong Law of Large Numbers
In the ideal world
-> P(... = mu) = 1
-> Showcase with Ex 1

## Random variable for sample statistics
-> A probability distribution for sample statistics?
-> How about something a bit more general

```{r}
sds <- sapply(1:5000, \(x) {
  y <- rnorm(25, 100, 25)
  sd(y)
})
```

## Central Limit Theorem
-> Defn
-> Model assumptions to use Normal as the probability distribution

## Sampling distribution of *x&#772;*
-> 


## [Ex 4:]{style='color: tomato;'} Beer!

Suppose a beer is sold in 330ml bottles. Each bottle is supposed to
contain 330ml, but due to variation in the manufacturing process, the real
amount is Normally Distributed with mean 328ml and standard deviation
of 3ml.
a) Find the probability that a randomly selected bottle contains less
than 330ml
b) Find the probability that the average volume of bottles of beer in a
randomly selected crate of beer (24 bottles) contains more than
330ml
