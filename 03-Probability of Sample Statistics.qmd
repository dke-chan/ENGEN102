How is data generated

Define Sample
-> Probability statement of a sample

Sample statistics
-> Changes sample-to-sample

In the ideal world
-> P(... = mu) = 1
-> Showcase with Ex 1

A probability distribution for sample statistics?

Central Limit Theorem
-> Defn
-> Model assumptions to use Normal as the probability distribution

Define Sample Distribution of xbar
-> 

Ex 4 (Paul's example with beer?)

Why Model Assumptions?s
