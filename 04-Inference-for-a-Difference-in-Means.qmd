## Motivation

## Sampling Distribution of the Difference in Sample Means

## Standard Error of *x&#772;*~1~ &minus; *x&#772;*~2~

## [Ex ?:]{.red} Handedness and Earnings

## Estimation of the Difference in Means

## Interpretation of the Confidence Interval

## Test for the Difference in Means

## Using Student's *t*-distribution to Calculate the *p*-value

## Interpretation of the Hypothesis Test

## [Ex ?:]{.red} Jet Noise
